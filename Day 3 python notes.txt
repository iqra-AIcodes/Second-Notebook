Day 3 Python Basics Notes

 1️⃣ What is a Variable?
A variable is like a container that stores data (numbers, text, etc.)
You can use it to remember information and use it later in your program.

Example:
age = 20          # 'age' stores the number 20
name = "Rimsha"   # 'name' stores the text "Rimsha"
print(age, name)

# Tip: Choose meaningful variable names like 'age', 'score', 'username'

 2️⃣ What is input()?
 input() is used to take input from the user.
 Whatever the user types is stored as a string by default.

# Example:
user_name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello,", user_name)

# Tip: Use input() when you want the program to interact with the use.

 3️⃣ What is int()?
 int() converts a value into an integer (whole number).
 Useful when you get numbers from input() because input() returns a string.

# Example:
num_str = input("Enter a number: ")  # input is a string
num = int(num_str)                    # convert to integer
print("Number + 5 =", num + 5)

# Tip: Always convert input to int if you want to do math operations

4️⃣ What is a Loop?
 A loop repeats a block of code multiple times.
 Common loops: for loop, while loop

# Example (for loop):
for i in range(5):  # repeats 5 times
    print("Hello", i)

# Example (while loop):
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print("Count is", count)
    count += 1  # increase count

# Tip: Use loops to save time instead of writing repetitive code

 5️⃣ What is a Function?
 A function is a block of code that performs a specific task.
 You can "call" it anytime in your program.

# Example:
def greet(name):
    print("Hello,", name)

greet("Rimsha")
greet("Ali")

# Tip: Use functions to organize your code and make it reusable
